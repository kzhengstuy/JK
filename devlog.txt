The developers' log!!

The Log:


Day 1: 2014-01-13

Start of the work.
Kenny and Jim begin making the bajillions of files needed for the Pokemon Adventure Simulator.They all are hollow.


Day 2: 2014-01-14

Jim's machine at school isn't working. Kenny makes hollow files for each of the individual Pokemon, with Jim backseat coding, occasionally hopping to the wheel to pilot the computer.


Day 3: 2014-01-15

Jim makes the generic trainer class and some hollow trainer subclasses.
Kenny makes more Pokemon shells.


Day 4: 2014-01-16

Jim finishes some generic trainer class files! For the most part... For a while...
Kenny makes even MORE Pokemon (because we need so many) and prompts Jim to make the driver file; Kenny makes an empty shell for the driver


Day 5: 2014-01-17

Jim works on driver file "PAS.java"
Kenny takes the backseat


Day 6: 2014-01-21

Jim has encountered a problem: letting the player pick his first Pokemon! NullPointerException is the problem; it's in Player.java.
Kenny, as a result, rolls on over to Player.java to figure out what's wrong.
Jim tries to make it work from withing PAS.java


Day 7: 2014-01-22

Kenny has an idea for a solution. He runs Player.java and makes it work, but convoluted-ness makes it not work in PAS.java, where it should be.
Jim backseats. Begins writing devlog.


Day 8: 2014-01-23

Kenny is out sick while Jim works in class on PAS.java.
Kenny's version of PAS.java and Player.java are lost!! Hopefully not for good.
Jim has made progress: you can now add your Pokemon and stuff, but the Pokemon shows up as null.
Begin making battling and healing functionality, but it doesn't work because it requires a Pokemon to exist.
Functionality for battling taken over by Kenny.
